# "Delver"

This is the latest project in which I try out various node-based frameworks and tools. Most recently, I successfully figured out how to chain pipes together in gulp using the "pump" module. To demo this, (after installing dependencies - run `npm install` first), run `gulp`, then `gulp compress`, and look at the diff between _dist and _compressed

Next: will write some dummy classes and experiment with different methods of minification to figure out what the best compression algorithm is!

## Station

I heard on the radio about a science contest where high schoolers had to design a space station for 10,000 humans. So I thought, why not try to create a simulation? And why not learn how to use Ava / Babel / ESnext while I'm at it?
