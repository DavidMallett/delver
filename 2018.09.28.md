tl;dr talked to someone (Cecil Hansen, whom I knew from camp) about Ian today. He asked me months ago what happened when he saw my status, around the time Ian died. I've been running. I also think that may be what triggered my current, well, the current state I'm in in which I'm devoted to consuming and processing new information and knowledge 24/7 (previously, I thought it was the result of nootropics). At worst it's mania; at best, I truely am great and have the capacity to change the world in a way other people don't. I dare not think the latter, though. I don't even want to think it; putting such a wild, grandiose burden on my psyche is bound to have severe consequences. Better to be cautious than arrogant (the latter being a strictly worse characteristic than the former). Perhaps Ian's soul has bound itself to mine and this is basically Super Saiyan mode (if indeed the concept of a "soul" is real) as a result of him gifting me his drive to succeed.

Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. If I block out the memory of Ian's death, then I risk making the same misstep he did. I should talk about this with Gary about this every time I go for the forseeable future as he is the one in my life best equipped to help me handle this.

The concept of insurance is so fucked up. The only reason it exists in the first place is because we have made healthcare a luxury rather than a privilege. It boggles my mind that in the 21st century, with all the progress we've made, many people still readily accept - or at least fail to challenge - the notion that we have all this sweet technology and science we _could_ use to help people who need it, but instead we sell healthcare like a fucking product, to say nothing of the pharmaceutical executives who jack up the price of their drug just because they can. Costs of drugs/equipment have become so inflated that not only did we have to create a whole new industry designed to profit from it, now we can't even afford to do R&D. Someone, somewhere, deliberately designed a Machiavellian web of regulations that drug companies have to navigate, and probably got zillions of dollars of kickbacks for giving the industry the excuse they needed to charge hundreds of dollars for tongue depressors - so now they can easily afford to pay for "lobbyists" (how the fuck is this different in practice from giving someone a fat fucking bribe or paying $50 on the internet for one of Donald Trump's friends to mention your name to him?) and they are heavily incentivized to entrench themselves and invest all their resources in preserving the status quo for eternity.

Today were the (Brett) Kavanaugh / Blasey-Ford hearings. tl;dr of the situation so far: Trump won POTUS election in 2016 because of Russian hacking and propaganda / (mis)information campaigns; does a myriad of stupid things (installs unqualified family members in important government positions; pulls out of mutually beneficial trade deals because he's so fucking dumb he doesn't know what "mutually beneficial" even means; refuses to acknowledge that neo-nazis are bad; continues to obviously launder money by running up huge bills vacationing at his various hotels _and_ forcing the secret service to stay there; etc) proceeds to attempt to slash and burn the white house to the ground and make off like a bandit to Russia, while so painfully clearly under Putin's thumb and a puppet, whose strings were pulled by the sycophants surrounding him. Gets investigated by FBI. Fires head of the FBI thinking it will make them go away; in doing so, draws more attention to himself and triggers an independent federal investigation by the Deputy AG (Rosenstein) and Special Prosecutor (Mueller). Spends following months frantically trying to gaslight the world via Twitter and discredit all sources of information besides Fox News while the investigation takes down his wranglers, goons, and flunkies . The emperor has no clothes, but the office of POTUS is so prestigious, so honorable, and the fundamentals of democracy even more so, that nobody said or did anything about it, and to this day a large portion of people are _still_ lying to themselves about it (or else racist or have some other sort of fucked up antisocial value system), and in fact they've flocked to and now surrounded him such that nobody on the outside can see his lack of clothes. But now he's also started jerking off and flinging shit and jizz at people (which is just _so_ belligerent) and probably smoking meth, and the people closest to him who were protecting and enabling him were all put in jail, so it's only a matter of time before either he has an aneurysm or a child finally points out his lack of clothes and other uncouth behaviors.

This is a day I'm probably going to tell my children and grandchildren about. I got to listen to several hours of it live. This is a hugely consequential moment for us, for me, Taylor- for the human fucking race. This is the last stand against an openly corrupt, openly racist, misogynistic, backwards-facing, borderline-fascist administration trying to put the last stone in place needed to cement its control on the third of three branches of government (9th seat on SCOTUS) so that they can get more money than they already have, at the cost of turning this country into a partisan authoritarian theocracy. Ironically, we had the opposite of a proletariat revolution - Russian propaganda game so strong that they misdirected the proletariat back at the bourgeoise who would have helped them, if only they were capable of not being completely selfish and self-centered pieces of shit (for fucking out loud, look who they picked to represent their values).

This is a dark time. But the night is darkest before dawn.
